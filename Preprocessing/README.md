# README.txt - Preprocessing

## Overview
This folder contains all files related to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing.

Data quality is essential for any machine learning project. Effective exploration, understanding, and preprocessing prepare data for model training and evaluation. Here, we explore and preprocess Lung X-ray Images data to ensure it is ready for model input.

## File Descriptions
- **Utilities.py**  
  Contains function definitions for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.

- **Preprocessing.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook that implements the functions from `Utilities.py` and displays the resulting outputs.
