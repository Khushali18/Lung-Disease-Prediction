# README.txt - Residual Neural Network (ResNet)

## Overview
Residual Neural Network (ResNet) is a neural network model uses convolutional approach to process and find patterns in images.

Since our data includes X-ray images of multiple classes. We have chosen ResNet model for multi-class classification as it performs best for image dataset

### Files:
- **Utilities.py**  
  Contains function definitions for training, testing, and evaluating the ResNet model.

- **ResNet_model_training_and_evaluation.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook implementing the training and testing of the ResNet model, with results.

- **resnet_model.h5**  
  Saved model trained on training and validation data.

The ResNet model performs well for image data.
