# README.txt - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Overview
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a neural network model uses convolutional layers to process and find patterns in images.

Since our data includes X-ray images of multiple classes. We have chosen CNN model for multi-class classification as it performs best for image dataset

### Files:
- **Utilities.py**  
  Contains function definitions for training, testing, and evaluating the CNN model.

- **CNN_model_training_and_evaluation.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook implementing the training and testing of the CNN model, with results.

- **cnn_model.h5**  
  Saved model trained on training and validation data.

The CNN model performs well for image data.
